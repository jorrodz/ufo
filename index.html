<p>An unidentified flying object (UFO) is any perceived aerial phenomenon that <strong>cannot be immediately identified or explained</strong>. On investigation, most UFOs are <i>"identified"</i> as known objects or atmospheric phenomena, while a small number remain unexplained.</p>

<p><b>Scientists</b> and <b>skeptic organizations</b> such as the <a href="https://skepticalinquirer.org/" title="CSI">Committee for Skeptical Inquiry</a> have provided prosaic explanations for a large number of claimed UFOs being caused by natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, or hoaxes. Small but vocal groups of <i>"ufologists"</i> favour unconventional, pseudoscientific hypotheses, some of which go beyond the typical extraterrestrial visitation claims and sometimes form part of new religions.</p>

<p>While unusual sightings have been reported in the sky throughout history, UFOs did not achieve their current cultural prominence until the period after <b>World War II</b>, escalating during the <b>Space Age</b>. The 20th century saw studies and investigations into UFO reports conducted by governments (such as Projects <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Grudge" title="Project Grudge">Grudge</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Sign" title="Project Sign">Sign</a> in the United States, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Condign" title="Project Condign">Project Condign</a> in the United Kingdom), as well as by organisations and individuals.</p>
