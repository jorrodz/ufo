        <h1>Terminology</h1>

<section>
<p>The term "UFO" (or "UFOB") was coined in 1953 by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">USAF</span>United States Air Force</a> (USAF) to serve as a catch-all for all such reports. In its initial definition, the USAF stated that a "UFOB" was "any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar object". Accordingly, the term was initially restricted to that fraction of cases which remained unidentified after investigation, as the USAF was interested in potential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">National Security</span>national security</a> reasons and "technical aspects" (see <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Air_Force_Regulation_200-2,_Unidentified_Flying_Objects_Reporting" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">AFR 200-2</span>Air Force Regulation 200-2</a>).</p>

<p>During the late 1940s and through the 1950s, UFOs were often referred to popularly as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_saucer" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Flying Saucer</span>flying saucers</a>" or "flying discs" due to the term being introduced in the context of the Kenneth Arnold incident. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_saucer" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Avro Canada</span>Avro Canada</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Canada_VZ-9_Avrocar" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">V2-9AV Avrocar</span> VZ-9AV Avrocar</a> was a concept vehicle produced during the 1950s, which was a functional aircraft with a saucer shape. UFOs were commonly referred to colloquially, as a "Bogey" by Western military personnel and pilots during the cold war. The term "bogey" was originally used to report anomalies in radar blips, to indicate possible hostile forces that might be roaming in the area.</p>

<p>The term UFO became more widespread during the 1950s, at first in technical literature, but later in popular use. UFOs garnered considerable interest during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Cold War</span>Cold War</a>, an era associated with a heightened concerns about national security, and, more recently, in the 2010s, for unexplained reasons. Nevertheless, various studies have concluded that the phenomenon does not represent a threat, and nor does it contain anything worthy of scientific pursuit (e.g., 1951 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Saucer_Working_Party" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">MOD</span>Flying Saucer Working Party</a>, 1953 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson_Panel" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Robertson Panel</span>CIA Robertson Panel</a>, USAF <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Blue_Book" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Project Blue Book</span>Project Blue Book</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condon_Committee" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Condon Committee</span>Condon Committee)</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>Oxford English Dictionary</a> defines a UFO as "An unidentified flying object; a 'flying saucer'". The first published book to use the word was authored by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Keyhoe" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Donald E. Keyhoe</span>Donald E. Keyhoe</a>.</p>

<p>As an acronym, "UFO" was coined by Captain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_J._Ruppelt" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Edward J. Ruppelt</span>Edward J. Ruppelt</a>, who headed Project Blue Book, then the USAF's official investigation of UFOs. He wrote, "Obviously the term 'flying saucer' is misleading when applied to objects of every conceivable shape and performance. For this reason the military prefers the more general, if less colorful, name: unidentified flying objects. UFO (pronounced yoo-foe) for short." Other phrases that were used officially and that predate the UFO acronym include "flying flapjack", "flying disc", "unexplained flying discs", and "unidentifiable object".</p>

<p>In popular usage, the term UFO came to be used to refer to claims of alien <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Spacecraft</span>spacecraft</a>, and because of the public and media ridicule associated with the topic, some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ufology" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Ufologists</span>ufologists</a> and investigators prefer to use terms such as "unidentified aerial phenomenon" (UAP) or "anomalous phenomena", as in the title of the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena (NARCAP). "Anomalous aerial vehicle" (AAV) or "unidentified aerial system" (UAS) are also sometimes used in a military aviation context to describe unidentified targets.</p>
