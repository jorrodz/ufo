       <h1>History of UFOs</h1>

       <section id="history">

        <h2>Early history before the 20th century</h2><br>

        <p>The 1561 celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg as printed in an illustrated news notice. UFO enthusiasts have described the phenomenon as an aerial battle of extraterrestrial origin. Skeptics find the phenomenon likely to have been a sun dog.</p>
        
        <p>People have observed the sky throughout history, and sometimes seen unusual sights: such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Comets</span>comets</a>, bright <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoroid#Meteor" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Meteors</span>meteors</a>, one or more of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_planet" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Five planets that can be readily seen with the nacked eye</span>five planets that can be readily seen with the naked eye</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astronomy)" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">planetary Conjunctions</span>planetary conjunctions</a>, and atmospheric <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_phenomena" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Optical Phenomena</span>optical phenomena</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dog" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Parhelia</span>parhelia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_cloud" class="tooltip">lenticular clouds</a>. One particularly famous example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Halley's Comet</span>Halley's Comet</a>: this was recorded first by Chinese astronomers in 240 BC and possibly as early as 467 BC. As it reaches the inner solar system every 76 years, it was often identified as a unique isolated event in ancient historical documents whose authors were unaware that it was a repeating phenomenon. Such accounts in history often were treated as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Supernatural</span>supernatural</a> portents, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Angels</span>angels</a>, or other religious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omen" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Omens</span>omens</a>. While UFO enthusiasts have sometimes commented on the narrative similarities between certain religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports, the canonical and symbolic character of such images is documented by art historians placing more conventional religious interpretations on such images.</p>
        
        <h3><b>Some examples of pre-modern observations of unusual aerial phenomena:</b></h3><br>

        <ul>
            <li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Obsequens" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Julius Obsequens</span>Julius Obsequens</a> was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Roman</span>Roman</a> writer who is believed to have lived in the middle of the fourth century AD. The only work associated with his name is the Liber de prodigiis (Book of Prodigies), completely extracted from an epitome, or abridgment, written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livy" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Livy</span>Livy</a>; De prodigiis was constructed as an account of the wonders and portents that occurred in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Rome</span>Rome</a> between 249 and 12 BCE. An aspect of Obsequens' work that has inspired excitement in some UFO enthusiasts is that he makes reference to things moving through the sky. It is possible that it is a description of meteors, and, since Obsequens is writing some 400 years after the events he describes, the text is not an eye-witness account.</p></li>

            <li><p>On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1561_celestial_phenomenon_over_Nuremberg" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">April 14, 1561</span>April 14, 1561</a>, residents of Nuremberg described the appearance of a large black triangular object. According to witnesses, there were also hundreds of spheres, cylinders and other odd-shaped objects that moved erratically overhead. The accounts are consistent with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dog" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Sun Dogs</span>sun dogs</a> and other similar meteorological phenomena. A similar report comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1566_celestial_phenomenon_over_Basel" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">1566 Over Basel</span>1566 over Basel</a> and, indeed, in the 15th and 16th centuries, many leaflets wrote of "miracles" and "sky spectacles".</p></li>

            <li><p>On January 25, 1878, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denison,_Texas" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Denison</span>Denison</a> Daily News printed an article in which John Martin, a local farmer, had reported seeing a large, dark, circular object resembling a balloon flying "at wonderful speed". Martin, according to the newspaper account, said it appeared to be about the size of a saucer from his perspective, one of the first uses of the word "saucer" in association with a UFO. In April of that year, reports of such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_airship" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Mistery Airships</span>"mystery airships"</a> in various parts of the United States are reminiscent of modern UFO waves. Many signed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Affidavits</span>affidavits</a>. Scores of people even reported talking to the pilots. Reports of strange ships and artificial lights in the sky were published in local newspapers for the next two decades culminating in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_psychogenic_illness" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Mass Panic</span>mass panic</a> in 1897 where some people feared that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Thomas Edison</span>Thomas Edison</a> had created an artificial star that could fly around the country. When asked his opinion of such reports, Edison said, "You can take it from me that it is a pure fake."</p></li>

        <h3><b>20th century and after</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>In the Pacific and European theatres during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">World War II</span>World War II</a>, round, glowing fireballs known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_fighter" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Foo Fighters</span>foo fighters</a>" were reported by Allied and Axis pilots. Some proposed Allied explanations at the time included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo%27s_fire" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">ST. Elmos' Fire</span>St. Elmo's fire</a>, the planet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Venus</span>Venus</a>, hallucinations from oxygen deprivation, or German secret weapons. In 1946, more than 2,000 reports were collected, primarily by the Swedish military, of unidentified aerial objects over the Scandinavian nations, along with isolated reports from France, Portugal, Italy and Greece. The objects were referred to as "Russian hail" (and later as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_rockets" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Ghost Rockets</span>ghost rockets</a>") because it was thought the mysterious objects were possibly Russian tests of captured German V1 or V2 rockets. Most were identified as natural phenomena as meteors.</p>
        
        <p>The popular UFO craze by many accounts began with a media frenzy surrounding the reports on June 24, 1947 that a civilian pilot named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arnold" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Kenneth Arnold</span>Kenneth Arnold</a> reported seeing nine objects flying in formation near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Mount Rainier</span>Mount Rainier</a> in the United States. At the time, he claimed he described the objects flying in a saucer-like fashion, leading to newspaper accounts of "flying saucers" and "flying discs". Soon, reports of flying saucer sightings became a daily occurrence with one particularly famous example being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell_incident" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Roswell Incident</span>Roswell Incident</a> where remnants of a downed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation_balloon" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Observation Ballon</span>observation balloon</a> were recovered by a farmer and confiscated by military personnel. The story received scant attention at the time, but interest in it revived in the 1990s with the publicity surrounding the television broadcast of an Alien autopsy video marketed as "real footage" but later admitted to be a staged "re-enactment". Various UFO claimants said that they had interacted with the aliens driving the spacecraft and a few said they had visited the crafts themselves. In 1961, the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_abduction" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Alien Abduction</span>alien abduction</a> account was sensationalized when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_and_Betty_Hill" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Barney and Betty Hill</span>Barney and Betty Hill</a> went under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnosis" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Hypnosis</span>hypnosis</a> after seeing a UFO and reported <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovered-memory_therapy" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Omens</span>recovered memories</a> of their experience that became ever more elaborate as the years went by.</p>
        
        <p>As media accounts and speculation were running rampant in the US, by 1953 intelligence officials (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson_Panel" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Robertson Panel</span>Robertson Panel</a>) worried that "genuine incursions" by enemy aircraft "over U.S. territory could be lost in a maelstrom of kooky hallucination" of UFO reports. Media were enlisted to help debunk and discourage UFO reports, culminating in a 1966 TV special, “UFO: Friend, Foe or Fantasy?”, in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Walter Cronkite</span>Walter Cronkite</a> "patiently" explained to viewers that UFOs were fantasy. Cronkite enlisted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Carl Sagan</span>Carl Sagan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Allen_Hynek" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">J. Allen Hynek</span>J. Allen Hynek</a>, who told Cronkite, “To this time, there is no valid scientific proof that we have been visited by spaceships". Fellow NICAP official <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Keyhoe" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Donald E. Keyhoe</span>Donald E. Keyhoe</a> wrote that Vice Admiral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_H._Hillenkoetter" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Roscoe Hillenkoetter</span>Roscoe Hillenkoetter</a>, the first director of the CIA, "wanted public disclosure of UFO evidence".</p>
        
        <p>A 1969 National Academy of Sciences panel reviewed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condon_Committee" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Condon Report</span>Condon Report</a> and concurred with its finding, observing that, “While further study of particular aspects of the topic (e.g., atmospheric phenomena) may be useful, a study of UFOs in general is not a promising way to expand scientific understanding of the phenomena.” Referencing the panel's conclusions, the Pentagon announced that it would no longer investigate UFO reports. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Kloor" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Keith Kloor</span>Keith Kloor</a>, the "allure of flying saucers" remained popular with the public into the 1970s, spurring production of such sci-fi films, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Close Encounters of The Third Kind</span>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_(film)" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Alien</span>Alien</a>, which "continued to stoke public fascination". Kloor writes that by the late 1990s, "other big UFO subthemes had been prominently introduced into pop culture, such as the abduction phenomenon and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Government Conspiracy</span>government conspiracy narrative</a>, via best-selling books and, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">The X-Files</span>The X-Files</a>".<p>

        <h3><b>Astronomer reports</b></h3><br>
        
        <p>The USAF's Project Blue Book files indicate that approximately 1% of all unknown reports came from amateur and professional astronomers or other telescope users (such as missile trackers or surveyors). In 1952, astronomer J. Allen Hynek, then a consultant to Blue Book, conducted a small survey of 45 fellow professional astronomers. Five reported UFO sightings (about 11%). In the 1970s, astrophysicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_A._Sturrock" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Peter A. Sturrock</span>Peter A. Sturrock</a> conducted two large surveys of the AIAA and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Astronomical_Society" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">American Astronomical Society</span>American Astronomical Society</a> (AAS). About 5% of the members polled indicated that they had had UFO sightings.</p>
        
        <p>Astronomer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Tombaugh" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Clyde Tombaugh</span>Clyde Tombaugh</a>, who saw six UFOs, including three green fireballs, supported the extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs and said scientists who dismissed it without study were "unscientific". Another astronomer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_LaPaz" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Lincoln LaPaz</span>Lincoln LaPaz</a>, headed the United States Air Force's investigation into green fireballs and other UFO phenomena in New Mexico. LaPaz reported two personal sightings, of a green fireball and a disc. (Both Tombaugh and LaPaz were part of Hynek's 1952 survey.) Hynek took two photos through the window of a commercial airliner of a disc that seemed to keep pace with his aircraft.</p>
        
        <p>Astronomer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Fraknoi" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Andrew Fraknoi</span>Andrew Fraknoi</a> rejected the hypothesis that UFOs are extraterrestrial spacecraft and responded to the "onslaught of credulous coverage" in books, films and entertainment by teaching his students to apply critical thinking to such claims, advising them that "being a good scientist is not unlike being a good detective". According to Fraknoi, UFO reports "might at first seem mysterious", but "the more you investigate, the more likely you are to find that there is LESS to these stories than meets the eye".</p>
        
        <p>In a 1980 survey of 1800 members of amateur astronomer associations by Gert Helb and Hynek for CUFOS, 24% responded "yes" to the question "Have you ever observed an object which resisted your most exhaustive efforts at identification?"</p>

            <li><p>Ed Walters, a building contractor, in 1987 allegedly perpetrated a hoax in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Breeze,_Florida" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Gulf Breeze, Florida</span>Gulf Breeze, Florida</a>. Walters claimed at first having seen a small UFO flying near his home and took some photographs of the craft. Walters reported and documented a series of UFO sightings over a period of three weeks and took several photographs. These sightings became famous, and are collectively referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Breeze_UFO_incident" class="tooltip"><span class="classic">Gulf Breeze UFO Incident</span>Gulf Breeze UFO Incident</a>. Three years later, in 1990, after the Walters family had moved, the new residents discovered a model of a UFO poorly hidden in the attic that bore an undeniable resemblance to the craft in Walters' photographs. Most investigators, like the forensic photo expert William G. Hyzer, now consider the sightings to be a hoax.</p></li>
